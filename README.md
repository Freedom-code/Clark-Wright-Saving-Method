# Clark-Wright-Saving-Method
Function: It transforms the thoughts of CW Saving Method into codes. It's often used to generate a good-quality initial feasible solution for some heuristic methods.

Imageine there are 82 points in an area. And there's a depot where numberous vehicles are included. Both the points and the depot's coordinates are given in nodes_coordinates.csv. Clark-Wright Saving Method is coded to solve this problem.

To run these codes, first of all, you should save all three files into one directory. And then, install some necessary third-party packages such as numpy and pandas.

Note: I am a new comer for python programming. Please notify me if you can make some improvements to my codes. Thanks for your attention and contribution.
